# surfs_up
Module 9 challenge

## Overview
  The purpose of this project is to use Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to analyze the differences between temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii between the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
  The three key differences in weather between June and December are:
  - The minimum temperature in June was 64 degrees, and 56 degrees in December.
  - The mean temperature in June was 75 degrees, and 71 degrees in December.
  - The range of temperatures in June was 21 degrees, and 27 degrees in December.

## Summary
  In summary, there is not a massive difference between temperatures in Oahu between Decemeber and June according to this analysis. The means are within 4 degrees, the max is within 2 degrees, and the only major difference is the 8 degrees between June and Decembers minimum tmperatures. Two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December would be
  -W. Avy said the last surf shop he invested in failed because it got "rained out." Looking at rainfall patterns between June and December would be important for the business.
  -Amount of daylight correlates to temperatures, but would be an important aspect to look at for ice cream sales
